		/** A headless controller that manages client connections.

		 The server class is designed to provide a very lightweight container for ServerSockets. As it is possible that there is more than one port for incoming
		 connections (IPv4, IPv6, etc), there may be more than one ServerSocket instance accept()ing incoming connections. Thus, this class can be initialized
		 with a service name and socket type, and will automatically construct all the required ServerSocket instances.

		 It is generally expected that one would subclass and override connection_callback to instantiate an appropriate subclass of ClientSocket, and
		 begin communcation. You also need to override the constructor to call bind_to_service() with appropriate parameters.

		 This class, when overriddden correctly, can act as a gatekeeper, checking the remote address or resource limits, and closing connections depending on
		 circumstances.

		/** Creates a thread to run an instance of Server.

		 When creating software which manages a server or set of servers, it is useful to have some kind of multi-threaded container for different instances
		 of the server. This allows multiple cores to be used when the client and server are both on the local machine, for example.

		 A server container provides all the needed infrastructure (such as runloop) to run the server correctly, and is designed to provide a very simple
		 interface to starting and stopping a server thread.
